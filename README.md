# TokenIndexer

Token Indexer is light weight computation infrastructure for building historical indexes of tokens and accounts. The computation platform takes snapshots on accounts and tokens on-chain and enriches this data with metadata from Helius to build up the historical index.
The computation infra is easy to setup as most of it is configured in json files, also known as infrastructure as code.

# Demo
